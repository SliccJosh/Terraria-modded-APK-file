You may have to edit the .sh file after you download the apk file.


Running a .sh file on a Chromebook without enabling Linux (Crostini) or Developer Mode is quite limited, as Chrome OS is designed to be a secure and restricted environment. However, there are still a few workarounds you can consider:

Method 1: Using Android Apps (Termux)
If your Chromebook supports Android apps, you can use an app like Termux to run shell scripts. Termux is a powerful terminal emulator for Android.

Install Termux:

Open the Google Play Store on your Chromebook.
Search for "Termux" and install it.
Transfer the .sh File:

Move your .sh file to a location accessible by Termux, such as the Downloads folder.
Run the Script:

Open Termux.
Navigate to the location of your script:
sh
cd /storage/emulated/0/Download
Make the script executable:
sh
chmod +x your_script.sh
Run the script:
sh
./your_script.sh
Method 2: Using Chrome Extensions
There are extensions available that provide terminal-like functionality. One such extension is "Secure Shell (SSH)".

Install Secure Shell (SSH):

Open the Chrome Web Store.
Search for "Secure Shell" and install the extension.
Running Local Scripts:

This method is more suited for SSH connections rather than running local scripts directly. However, you can set up an SSH server on another machine and use Secure Shell to connect and run scripts on that machine.
Method 3: Using Web-Based Terminals
There are various web-based terminals and IDEs that might allow you to run shell scripts remotely.

Use an Online IDE:

Websites like Repl.it or Glitch provide online development environments where you can run shell scripts.
Create a New Project:

Create a new project on your chosen platform.
Upload your .sh file to the project.
Use the terminal provided by the platform to run your script.
Summary
While running .sh files directly on a Chromebook without enabling Linux or Developer Mode is restrictive, using Android apps like Termux or web-based solutions can provide a viable workaround. If you need more advanced capabilities, enabling Linux (Crostini) is recommended for a more seamless experience.
